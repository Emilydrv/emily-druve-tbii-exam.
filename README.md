# Hey, welcome to Pet-Match!
This repository consists of my this read me file, a short report on the progress of creating my Tech Basics II project, an images folder with all the needed images, an src folder, a data folder with a prepared CSV file, and finally the MVP for my app Pet-Match.

The src folder, contains my helpers function, which includes the definition, that I repeat multiple times, in order to create a clean code. The prepared CSV file is included in the data folder, since I was one of those students, where the file was not created correctly when created through running the code, and I wanted to make sure, that this would definitely work in my final project.

# What is Pet-Match?
Pet-Match is my idea for an app to simplify the adoption process of pets from shelter, to help more people adopt pets instead of shopping for them, in order to go against the suffering that is brought upon these animals through mass breeding and breeding towards trends. 

# How does the App work?
When the user launches the app they will be created with the options of signing up or signing in. 
- New users should click the sign up option, which leads them to a page where they can put in data, that will then be stored in the prepared CSV file.
- Returning users should click the sign in option and enter their previously created username, to get right back to matching the kind of pet they are looking to adopt. 
- From each of the pet’s profiles, the user has the option to see more information about the pet, immediately contact the shelter, the animal is currently in, or go straight to the next pet.
